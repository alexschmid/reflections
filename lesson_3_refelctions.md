**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?**

When you might work on multiple devices or work as part of a team.

**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?**

To prevent your local copies being affected by changes to the remote repository (example: by other contributors).
