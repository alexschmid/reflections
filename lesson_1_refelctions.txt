**How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?**

It helped me see that there was a typo that needed to be corrected.

**How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?**

It would allow me to see how a project has changed over time.

**What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?**

Pro: able to find  a logical place to commit. Con: forgetting to commit.

**Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?**

Multiple files might be interrelated to eachother or the entire repository.

**How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?**

`git log` lets you see the history of git commits from newest to oldest and `git diff` lets you see what's changed from any two commits.

** How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?**

Knowing that you can go back, find a bug, and fix it.

**Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?**

Tracking changes over time.
